# **About Me**

"Early to bed, 
early to rise, 
work like hell, 
and advertise."

- Ted Turner

Hi I'm Anthony. 
<br>
I'm a Data Engineer at Facebook and Real Estate Investor based in the Bay Area. I started this site to document progress toward my goals, build a platform for my own content, and to add value to readers like yourself. Thanks for stopping by and feel free to drop me a message.
